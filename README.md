To run our code, you just need to open the notebooks in jupyter and run each cells.
If you just need to execute our code to have the best results, run the "Hybride Filtering - Page Rank x Cosine Similarity.ipynb" notebook.

Folder content:
- data/ => contain the datas:
	- dressipi\_recsys2022.zip => zip file containing the given files
	- get\_data.py => python file used to get datas from the previous zip file 
- functions/ => contain the functions:
	- page_rank.py => python file containing all the algorithms and models
- matrix\_saves/ => directory used to store important results that are very long to cumpute
